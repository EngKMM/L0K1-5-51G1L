## The Number One Hacker's Playbook
	This is the ultimate red teamer's companion, covering everything from quick syntax refreshers, to tools, frameworks, and techniques designed to help you orchestrate more structured, ruthless, and stealthy attack patterns
## The Mission
		I made this notebook for the sole purpose of having my personal hacking manual, and documenting my journey from a junior-level penetration tester to being a full-spectrum red teamer, my very own trickster's playbook.

## How it's gonna work:

	During the first phase of this project I will be writing about different subjects without much of a clear path, just writing along as I learn different concepts or techniques. Once I start to feel comfortable enough with what I have learned, I'm planning to write the yggdrasil (root) section on IT, InfoSec and programming fundamentals.

## Realms

	Basically my way of splitting up my notes into 9 large topic sections (realms) and one root (yggdrasil) section. Each of the 9 sections will contain a number of subsections in order to maintain structure and clarity as the memoire grows

### [[Muspelheim]]

The realm of fire where only the most venomous and mischievous **exploits** dwell......
### [[Helheim]]

The realm of the dead, where **shells** spawn from the underground like the dead.....

### [[Jötunheim]]

The realm of giants poking their heads from the clouds and escalating their privileges….

### Important

This playbook contains original content based on my personal learning journey in offensive security. Some sections may have been inspired by public resources such as TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and community writeups. All material has been rewritten, restructured, and expanded in my own words for clarity and educational purposes.  

This project is intended for ethical hacking and testing in authorized environments only. Always get explicit permission before applying any techniques.
